# Plus Feature Set

Bits of the engine related to things like Ballistica accounts and cloud
functionality. Due to its sensitive nature, source code to this part of the
engine is not available publicly. It is instead distributed as precompiled
static libraries which can be linked in with the rest of the open sourced
engine. The Plus feature can be removed from spinoff projects in order to create
a 100% open-source project.
