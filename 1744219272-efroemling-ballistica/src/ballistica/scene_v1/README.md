# Scene V1 Feature Set

Gameplay code for classic BombSquad, as well as app-modes and other support
classes required to use it.

Note that, ideally, gameplay code (scene version) should live in its own feature
set and app-mode code should live in another. That way a single app-mode can
wrangle multiple scene versions. But for historical reasons they're all mixed up
in this case.
