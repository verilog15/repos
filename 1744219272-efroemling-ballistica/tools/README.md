# Ballistica Tools

Code in this directory is used to build or test Ballistica projects but
(in most cases) is not available *from* a running Ballistica app.

Note that there are exceptions to this rule; some of the Python packages
here such as 'efro' or 'bacommon' are bundled with builds so can be used
from tools *and* app code.
