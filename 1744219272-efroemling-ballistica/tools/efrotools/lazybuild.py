    """Run a build if anything in some category is newer than a target.

    This can be used as an optimization for build targets that *always* run.
    As an example, a target that spins up a VM and runs a build can be
    expensive even if the VM build process determines that nothing has changed
    and does no work. We can use this to examine a broad swath of source files
    and skip firing up the VM if nothing has changed. We can be overly broad
    in the sources we look at since the worst result of a false positive change
    is the VM spinning up and determining that no actual inputs have changed.
    We could recreate this mechanism purely in the Makefile, but large numbers
    of target sources can add significant overhead each time the Makefile is
    invoked; in our case the cost is only incurred when a build is triggered.

    Note that target's mod-time will *always* be updated to match the newest
    source regardless of whether the build itself was triggered.
