"""Wrangles pcommandbatch; an efficient way to run small pcommands.

The whole purpose of pcommand is to be a lightweight way to run small
snippets of Python to do bits of work in a project. The pcommand script
tries to minimize imports and work done in order to keep runtime as
short as possible. However, even an 'empty' pcommand still takes a
fraction of a second due to the time needed to spin up Python and import
a minimal set of modules. This can add up for large builds where
hundreds or thousands of pcommands are being run.

To help fight that problem, pcommandbatch introduces a way to run
pcommands by submitting requests to temporary local server daemons.
This allows individual pcommand calls to go through a lightweight client
binary that simply forwards the command to a running server. This cuts
minimum pcommand runtimes down greatly. Building and managing the server
and client are handled automatically, and systems which are unable to
compile a client binary can fall back to using vanilla pcommand in those
cases.

A few considerations must be made when using pcommandbatch. By default,
all existing pcommands have been fitted with a disallow_in_batch() call
which triggers an error under batch mode. These calls should be removed
if/when each call is updated to work cleanly in batch mode. Guidelines
for batch-friendly pcommands follow:

- Batch mode runs parallel pcommands in different background threads
  and may process thousands of commands in a single process.
  Batch-friendly pcommands must behave reasonably in such an environment.

- Batch-enabled pcommands must not call os.chdir() or sys.exit() or
  anything else having global effects. This should be self-explanatory
  considering the shared server model in use.

- Batch-enabled pcommands must not use environment-variables to
  influence their behavior. In batch mode this would unintuitively use
  the environment of the server and not of the client.

- Batch-enabled pcommands should not look at sys.argv. They should
  instead use pcommand.get_args(). Be aware that this value does not
  include the first two values from sys.argv (executable path and
  pcommand name) so is generally cleaner to use anyway. Also be aware
  that args are thread-local, so only call get_args() from the thread
  your pcommand was called in.

- Batch-enabled pcommands should not use efro.terminal.Clr for coloring
  terminal output; instead they should use pcommand.clr() which properly
  takes into account whether the *client* is running on a tty/etc.

- Standard print and log calls (as well as those of child processes)
  will wind up in the pcommandbatch server log and will not be seen by
  the user or capturable by the calling process. For batch-friendly
  printing, use pcommand.clientprint(). Note that, in batch mode, all
  output will be printed on the client after the command completes and
  stderr and stdout will be printed separately instead of intermingled.
  If a pcommand is long-running and prints at multiple times while doing
  its thing, it is probably not a good fit for batch-mode.
