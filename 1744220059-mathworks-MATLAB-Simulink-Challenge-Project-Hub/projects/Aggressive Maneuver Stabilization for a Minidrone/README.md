## Motivation

The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle industry is a growing field with its applications in transportation, delivery, agriculture, and surveillance. The MathWorks tools play a crucial part in designing these systems using the Model-Based Design approach – whether to enable the [Pilotless Flight of Aurora Centaur](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/pilotless-flight-of-aurora-centaur-119494.html) or to develop Airnamics [Unmanned Aerial System for Close-Range Filming](https://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/airnamics-develops-unmanned-aerial-system-for-close-range-filming-with-model-based-design.html). 

Performing aggressive maneuvers is a challenging control problem for UAVs that need to be addressed for all applications where agile flying vehicles need to move with high acceleration and pass-through obstacles with a precise pose value that can approach singularity. Moreover, such control strategies will be necessary to overcome the hurdles caused by unexpected external circumstances – a strong gust of wind, relaunching from a failed vehicle landing, an obstacle disturbance in a cluttered space, etc.


## Project Description

Use MATLAB and Simulink to design and implement a non-linear control strategy able to deal with high disturbances, fast input variations, and track complex trajectories using the tools that are used by the aerospace industry. Provide an aggressive input to the minidrone to change its position and orientation and stabilize it to the designated position and orientation. 
Suggested Steps:
1.	Become familiar with the MATLAB and Simulink using resources listed in the Background Material section below.
2.	Install the [Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/63318-simulink-support-package-for-parrot-minidrones) from MATLAB-Add-Ons.
3.	Use the [Parrot Minidrone Hover Model](https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/parrot/ug/fly-a-parrot-minidrone-using-the-hover-simulink-model.html) as the baseline controller.
4.	Improve the altitude estimator and controller for flying over objects by using the pressure sensor along with the altitude sensor
5.	Design a controller to enable the vehicle to hover from
    - A freehand throw
    - A free fall
    - An upside-down orientation [1]
6.	Provide aggressive inputs to the aerial vehicle using inputs in simulations. Update the controller and state estimator to stabilize the minidrone’s flight. You can use the data from the minidrone’s sensors. 

7. Hardware Deployment: If you have the hardware available with you, deploy your algorithm designed in simulations on the Parrot Mambo Minidrone hardware. Check the Background Material for details.

Advanced project work:
1.	Generate a complex trajectory for maneuver to have the drone follow it – in simulations and deployed on the hardware.
Project variations:
1.	Implement a quaternion-based attitude controller and state estimator [2], [3] to enable the drone to perform a 360 degrees flip maneuver
