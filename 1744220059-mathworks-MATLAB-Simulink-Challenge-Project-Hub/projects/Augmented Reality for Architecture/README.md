## Motivation

Augmented reality (AR) combines the real world with computer generated content, often in an interactive way. Newer cell phones, VR headsets and even glasses now have some AR capabilities, and AR has been used for gaming, design, art, utility, and more. As companies strive to improve their sensors, display and computing hardware capabilities, AR will become increasingly commonplace and find new and exciting uses in the world. 

## Project Description

This project aims to bring to life architectural drawing using the [Computer Vision Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html). A live video stream of a 2D floor plan drawn or printed on paper will be processed and augmented with a 3D representation of the structure. 

Suggested steps: 

- Print or draw a floor plan consisting of line segments that represent walls onto a flat sheet of paper. 

- Record a video of the floor plan, moving the camera to view it from different angles. 

- Get the camera calibration parameters using the [Camera Calibrator App](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/cameracalibrator-app.html). 

- Determine the pose of the floor plan using either known features (e.g. [AprilTag](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/readapriltag.html)) or [detected features](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/feature-detection-and-extraction.html). 

- Detect the relevant floor plan features (e.g., lines for walls). 

- Augment the video with a 3D representation of the features and correct the visualization to match the perspective from the current pose of the camera. 

- Try running your algorithm in real-time on an incoming video feed from a webcam.  

Advanced work: 

- Use existing video features to estimate pose, rather than requiring a known added feature such as the AprilTag. 

- Include additional information in the floor plan, e.g., markers for windows, doors, furniture, colors, etc. and augment the 3D representation to show it. 

- Render features that obscure others with transparency. 

- Automatically adjust the colors of the rendered features to better match the lighting of the environment. 

- Automatically measure and display the lengths of walls with a scaling factor. 

- Compile and run in real-time on a cell phone or other mobile device.
