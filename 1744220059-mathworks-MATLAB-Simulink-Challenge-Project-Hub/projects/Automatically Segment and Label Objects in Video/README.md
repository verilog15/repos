## Motivation

The dream of delivering self-driving vehicles is the most exciting technical challenge of our lifetime. However, the early promise of achieving full autonomy (level 5) has been slowed down by the tremendous amount of labelled data required to build and validate robust AI algorithms needed to unlock level 5 autonomy. We desperately need better labeling tools that automatically label objects with minimal human intervention. Help build these labeling algorithms to accelerate our progress towards self-driving vehicles. 

## Project Description

Using MathWorks [Computer Vision Toolbox ™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html) and [Deep Learning Toolbox ™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html), design, implement, and test an algorithm to automatically segment and label the same object across a sequence of video frames with minimal human intervention. This process is often referred to as video object segmentation or video instance segmentation. Demonstrate the effectiveness of your algorithm compared to manual labeling by integrating the algorithm into the [Video Labeler app](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/videolabeler-app.html) and evaluating the time savings gained using automation.

Suggested steps:

1.	Get familiar with the [Video Laber app]((https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/videolabeler-app.html)) and how to [create an automation Algorithm for labeling](https://au.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/create-automation-algorithm-for-labeling.html).
2.	Review state-of-the-art techniques for video object segmentation. 
3.	Identify and evaluate the effectiveness of algorithms from [[1]](#yao) for label automation.
4.	Collect and prepare data required for training the algorithms, if needed.
5.	Integrate these algorithms into the video Labeler app.
6.	Measure the effectiveness of your labeling algorithm compared to manual labeling.

Initial set of objects for segmentation: vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, lane markers, drivable path, curbs, walkways.
