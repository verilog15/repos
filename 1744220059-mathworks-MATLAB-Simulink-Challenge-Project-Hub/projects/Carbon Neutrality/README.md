## Motivation

We are threatened by the global climate changes. In 2023, the global climate will be abnormal, and many countries are already experiencing continuous extreme high temperature and many natural disasters at the same time. Excessive carbon dioxide emissions are the main cause of global climate change, which will bring about a series of problems such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, high temperature and heat waves, and destruction of the ecological environment. Global realization of carbon neutrality is the only way to go under the background of climate warming, and it is also an inevitable choice for the sustainable development of the earth. Achieving carbon neutrality will realize the energy revolution and industrial transformation of transnational, cross-border, and global collaboration. In this context, analyzing and studying the carbon dioxide emissions of various countries (or regions) is of great significance to understand the trends of carbon emissions in various countries, formulate reasonable international cooperation programs, and achieve carbon neutrality on a global scale.

## Project Description

Suggested steps:

1.	Become familiar with the MATLAB based Econometrics, statistical learning examples listed in Background Material section below,
2.	Understand the [dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/5569235#.Y9fx40HMJhG) and data cleaning 
3.	According to the data properties, select and build the time series model from the [Econometric Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/econometrics.html) on carbon dioxide emissions of the selected countries and predict the future values,
4.	Suppose that we are convinced that carbon neutrality is attainable by 2050. Design the projected path of CO2 emissions in the next three decades. Use any of the methodologies from [Curve Fitting Toolboxâ„¢](https://www.mathworks.com/products/curvefitting.html) or from [Econometric Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/econometrics.html) (such as State space model).
5.	Apply the mapping toolbox to build the movies to reflect the changes on global CO2 emissions.

Advanced project work:

1.	Build an interactive app on presenting the time series model on CO2 emissions
2.	Integrate with the deep learning or machine learning models on time series data analysis
3.	Combine the data from different countries, construct a multidimensional model or design the statistics test to illustrate the importance of the international cooperation
