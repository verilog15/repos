## Motivation

Climate change poses a significant risk to coastal areas as rising global temperatures produce rising sea levels. 
According to [NOAA]( https&#58;//oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel.html), average global sea level rose 2.6 inches between 1993 and 2014. 
Rising sea levels will produce more frequent inland flooding and pose a significant risk to the houses, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure located in many coastal cities. 
Climate change models use many factors to generate region-specific sea level change and are essential to help communities assess the potential impact of rising sea levels, with applications for insurance, zoning, permitting, and potential re-location.

## Project Description

Work with [Mapping Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/mapping.html) to develop a function to calculate and visualize coastlines due to rising sea levels. Write an example to connect to a climate data server and visualize predicted coastlines at specific years in the future.

Suggested steps:
- Identify a coastal region of interest and find corresponding coastline and 3-D elevation data for the region. Find elevation data that is 10 meters or better resolution. Data sources vary for country and region; for example, a good source of elevation data for the United States is the [USGS National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/).
- Develop a MATLAB function using Mapping Toolbox to import the map data and produce a new coastline definition given a change in sea level. Visualize the changing coastline on a map.
- Find a climate data server to obtain predicted sea levels for the coastal region. Climate data servers provide various data sets generated from climate models. A couple of climate data servers to consider include [NOAA Digital Coast]( https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/) and [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/). See [Visualizations of Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Concentration]( https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/77542-visualizations-of-northern-hemisphere-sea-ice-concentration) for an example illustrating how to obtain and use data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store.
- Write an example that uses the climate data server’s predicted sea level and uses the function developed above to visualize predicted future coastlines, such as for 100 years into the future.

Project variations:
- Analyze and visualize different or additional impacts associated with rising sea levels, such as new flood zones or population displacement.

Advanced project work:
- Develop an app interface to enable the user to enter inputs like a sea level change value or future year and visualize the impact on a map.
- Extend the app to automate all access to the map data required for the calculations, including elevation data and the climate data. Use the automated access to enable the user to select an arbitrary coastline region to analyze instead of a pre-defined region.

## Background Material
