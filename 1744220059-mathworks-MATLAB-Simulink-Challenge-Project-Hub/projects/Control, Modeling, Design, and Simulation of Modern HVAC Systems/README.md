## Motivation

Society needs to create buildings and homes that are energy efficient and healthy for the inhabitants. Achieving this is challenging and requires devices to control air temperature, air humidity, and air quality while being energy efficient. The challenge is developing the systems and controllers to balance these many competing goals. Modeling, simulation, and control is key to developing optimized systems. 

## Project Description

The goal is to develop a model of a modern HVAC system which is quite complex. The overriding development philosophy is to start simple and add detail. 

Suggested steps:
1.	Get familiar with the two [Simscape™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html)-based models of HVAC systems, provided in the background material, and explore results through simulation.
2.	Search and learn various topics in HVAC systems. Some starting terms are heat pumps, energy recovery ventilators, forced hot water systems, air handlers, de-humidifiers, and humidifiers. This will give you an overview of some components of a HVAC system.
3.	Build a simple model of a room, cold outside environment, and a heating device. Develop a simple controller in Simulink and Stateflow to control the temperature. 
4.	Add complexity to your model to include a varying environment and a cooling system. 
5.	Add further complexity to control all aspects of the room including temperature, air quality, humidity, and pressure.
6.	Add complexity to the room to include a house with multiple rooms.

## Background Material

There are various Simscape based models of HVAC systems. Learn how these work and expand them to what you want to model and simulate.
1.	[House Heating System](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/simscape/ug/house-heating-system.html)
2.	[Vehicle HVAC System](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/simscape/ug/vehicle-hvac-system.html)
