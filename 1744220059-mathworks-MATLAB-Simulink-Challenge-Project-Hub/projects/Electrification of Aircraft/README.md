## Motivation

Energy used for transport is a significant percentage of each person’s energy utilization.  For example, in the UK, it is estimated that on average 32% of a person’s energy consumption is used for transport [Sustainable Energy – without the hot air - Current consumption](http://www.withouthotair.com/c19/page_116.shtml). 

Electrification of automotive vehicles is well underway, but there is still much to be done to electrify flight. The required energy density required for aircraft often comes from sources of combustion which are not sustainable or environmentally friendly.  Electrification of aircraft provides opportunity for propulsion energy to come from clean and renewable green energy sources.  To succeed it is essential that you provide clear, quantitative, data-driven conclusions underpinned by use of rigorous mathematical models and time-domain simulations. 

## Project Description

You will use an existing MATLAB®, Simulink®, and [Simscape™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html) representation of an all-electric aircraft as the basis for this project.  You will extend this by building models of a variety of aircraft electrical energy storage and equipment which permit a thorough evaluation of energy consumption.  Use the models to provide informed, data-driven, comparisons, and recommendations as to the most promising electrical configurations and technologies.

Suggested steps:
1. Become familiar with existing electric aircraft models (links below) and use these as the basis for your project.
2. Project variations: Choose one of the following project ideas:
	- Build or integrate a model of an energy storage system. Consider weight, size, and efficiency of one of:
		- Hydrogen
		- Fuel Cell
		- Battery
		- Other novel sources?
	- Use the model to compare advantages of different distribution systems:
		- AC
		- DC
		- Mixed AC/DC
	- Build or integrate a more detailed and representative model of one of these loads:
		- Propulsion
		- Sensors and electrical actuators
		- HVAC
		- Galley/Hotel
		- Infotainment
		- Other areas?
3. Calculate expected efficiency and power requirements for a variety of typical flights
4. Write up data-drive recommendations to influence each of:
	1. Individuals – should technologies you investigated influence flight purchasing decisions by passengers?
	2. Industry – should the technology you investigated be further developed and why?
	3. Government – shape government policy to direct investment and multiply the benefits

Advanced project work:
- Pick additional item/items from the project variations above.
- Parameterize the aircraft for multiple configurations: a variety of passenger capacities and multiple geographic locations.
- For comparative purposes, build one model of conventional
	- Propulsion, or
	- Actuation
