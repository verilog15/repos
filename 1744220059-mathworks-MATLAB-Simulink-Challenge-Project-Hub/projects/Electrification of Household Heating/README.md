## Motivation

In many temperate parts of the world, energy used for heating is a significant percentage of each person’s energy utilization.  For example, in the UK, it is estimated that on average 32% of a person’s energy consumption is used for heating, see [Sustainable Energy – without the hot air - Current consumption](http://www.withouthotair.com/c19/page_116.shtml).

Energy used for heating often comes from combustion of coal, gas, or oil which is not sustainable or environmentally friendly.  Electrification of heating systems provides opportunity for heating energy to come from clean and renewable green energy sources.


## Project Description

You will use MATLAB®, Simulink®, and [Simscape™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html) to build a thermal model of a house which includes conduction, convection, radiation, and thermal inertia to permit time-domain simulation.  Next, build a model of an electrical domestic heating system to permit thorough evaluation of energy consumption.  Then import data from appropriate sources to validate and verify the model.  Use the model to provide informed, data-driven, comparisons, and recommendations as to the most promising electrical heating technology.

Suggested steps:
1. Become familiar with existing Simscape thermal models of a domestic house (links below) and use these as the basis for your project.
2. Investigate refrigeration examples referenced below to transform them into heating examples.
3. Project variations: Use Simscape to build a simulation model of one type of electrical domestic heating system:
    - Electrical storage radiators, or
    - Air-sourced heat-pump (with electric motor driving pump), or
    - Ground-sourced heat pump (with electric motor driving pump), or
    - Any other promising technologies discovered from literature review.
4. Calculate expected efficiency of the technology.
5. Integrate heating system into model of house and provide concrete daily and annual efficiency results.
6. Write up data-driven recommendations to influence each of:
	1. Individuals – should that type be purchased and what are the benefits?
	2. Industry – should that technology be further developed and why?
	3. Government – shape government policy to direct investment and multiply the benefits

Advanced project work:
- Build models of more than one type of electrical domestic heating system.
- For comparative purposes, add models of other domestic heating sources, for example:
    - Gas boiler
    - Oil burner
    - Conventional air conditioning unit
    - Other renewable or nonrenewable options 
- Parameterize the house for multiple configurations: a variety of building materials and multiple geographic locations. How much energy storage would be required to meet daily and annual demand in different parts of the world?
- Extend your model to simulate an off-grid system – how many solar panels or wind-turbines would be required to make a household self-sustainable?
