## Motivation

The [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/) reports that the worldwide death toll due to landslides is in the thousands with most fatalities due to rock falls, debris flows, or volcanic debris flows. A Landslide Susceptibility Map (LSM) is an effective visualization for identifying the relative likelihood of future landslides in low and high-risk landslide regions. These maps can aid with understanding the potential for future landslides that can have devastating impacts on cites, power grids, transportation, and most importantly people.

## Project Description

Develop a complete MATLAB-based example that generates a Landslide Susceptibility Map as seen in [1]. The example would obtain the historical landslide data e.g., distance from roads, distance from geological faults, distance from water streams, land use type, etc. and apply the three-stage methodology (outlined in Figure 2 of [1]) to generate and visualize a geographic map,
color-coded with high and low landslide risk regions (as see in Figures 5 and 6  of [1]).

Suggested steps:
1.	Identify the regions for which required landslide data exists e.g., Muş, Turkey, Bandar Torkaman, Iran, etc.
2.	Fetch the required training data. You can adopt the tool [here](https://github.com/jeffreyevans/GradientMetrics) as per Reference [1].
3.	Implement the three-stage methodology as seen in Figure 2 of [1].
	1.	Pre-process spatial data using MATLAB®
	2.	Develop a cascade neural network model (cascadeforwardnet using trainlm training) using the [Deep Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
	3.	Use the [Mapping Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/mapping.html) to generate the risk map using a total of 24 variables
