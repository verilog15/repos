## Motivation

Data centers are growing at an amazing rate. They enable cloud computing and accessing incredible resources from anywhere across the globe. At their core, data centers house many power-hungry computers. Maintaining these computers at ideal temperatures allows them to perform at peak capacity and minimizes downtime. Cooling data centers requires large amounts of energy. Cooling too aggressively can increase costs and the carbon footprint of data centers, while under cooling can force systems offline or damage expensive equipment.
Intelligently cooling data centers given an understanding of the heat loads and cooling dynamics can help provide the highest uptime with the lowest carbon footprint.

## Project Description

Work with [Simscape™ Fluids™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape-fluids.html) to create a plant and controller for a data center cooling system with dynamic loads using MATLAB® and Simulink®. The model should be detailed enough to capture important dynamics.
Dynamic loads include outside environmental conditions and server loads. The heat generated should vary with load and temperature.
The cooling system should have a level of fidelity that includes performance under various operating conditions. 
A baseline thermostatic controller should be developed, and this should be improved with predictive or more intelligent control.
Demonstrate that the advanced control system can keep temperature in the desired range.
Demonstrate whether the control can allow for a greater performance envelope for the data center. Compute the difference in carbon footprint of using a baseline vs. advanced controller.

Suggested steps:

1. Perform a literature search to understand data center loads and cooling systems.
2. Create a dynamic data center cooling model. 
3. Model different loads that the data center can experience such as times of increased load or high external temperatures.
4. Create a baseline by implementing a simple controller.
5. Create a predictive controller using information such as expected load and external temperature.
6. Demonstrate the value of your controller in keeping the data center temperature controlled and compare the carbon footprint of the cooling system with different controllers.

Advanced project work:

Extend the work to predict component failures with different controllers and optimal placement of critical loads within the data center.
