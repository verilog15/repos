## Motivation

Drone-based photography in Mars or landing on the moon has become a realized dream today due to tremendous advancement in radio-communication technology. Intelligently designed antenna arrays are potential contributors for transmission and reception of such long distant signals. Large arrays of antennas find applications in recent technologies like in square kilometer array or in massive MIMO communication. When array size is electrically large like in reflector arrays, it urges for large amount of computational time and infrastructure, followed by a complex theoretical characterization. In such practical design applications of large arrays, MATLAB® based toolboxes like Antenna Toolbox™ and Optimization Toolbox™ can be potential solution for fast computation with limited resource. 

## Project Description

Use [Antenna Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/antenna.html) to characterize and optimize the desired transmission and reception characteristics of large antenna arrays. Unlike the popular stochastic approximation of array analysis, Antenna Toolbox provides a full-wave electromagnetic simulation to achieve more accurate results. 

Suggested steps:
1. Use the [*design*](https://www.mathworks.com/help/antenna/ref/design.html) function on an existing [antenna catalog]( https://www.mathworks.com/help/antenna/antenna-catalog.html) in Antenna Toolbox to design an isolated antenna element at any arbitrary frequency. 
2. Use [array catalog]( https://www.mathworks.com/help/antenna/array-catalog.html) of Antenna Toolbox to define a large array. 
3. Optimize multiple design parameters of the large array like antenna physical parameters, inter-element spacing or tilting, etc. using Antenna Toolbox in association with other MATLAB optimization Toolboxes. 
4. Compare large finite arrays with infinite array analysis of Antenna Toolbox and investigate the difference in the far-field radiation patterns. See this [example](https://www.mathworks.com/help/antenna/ug/modeling-mutual-coupling-in-large-arrays-using-infinite-array-analysis.html?searchHighlight=infinite%20array&amp;s_tid=srchtitle) 

Advanced project work: 

Currently design function provides the initial design of isolated metal only antenna. 
1. Use the simulation data obtained using Antenna Toolbox to build a data-driven prediction modelling of initial design parameters of the large array.
2. Derive standard design models for different class of arrays for different antenna elements.
