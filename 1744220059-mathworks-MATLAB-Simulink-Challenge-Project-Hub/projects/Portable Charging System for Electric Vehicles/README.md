## Motivation

Electric Vehicles are rising in popularity as the global trend towards electrification continues. However, this new and exciting technology also poses different challenges compared to conventional internal combustion engines, which will need new engineering solutions to resolve. 
One such challenge is the possibility of an electric vehicle running out of charge before it can reach a recharging station. In such a scenario, it might be easier to simply recharge the EV on-the-spot using a charged battery pack rather than putting in the much more substantial effort of towing it to another location. 
Solving this problem requires a detailed understanding of how battery packs and power electronics operate, and also of the control algorithms necessary to manage the charging process in accordance with established standards. 


## Project Description

Work with [Simscape™](https://in.mathworks.com/help/physmod/simscape/index.html) and [Simscape™ Electrical™](https://in.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sps/index.html) blocks to create a simulation model of a reference EV’s battery pack with electrical and thermal characteristics modelled. Next, devise a solution for transferring charge from an external battery through an intermediate power electronic circuit to the reference EV. Select an appropriate value of the charging rate and total power transferred, considering the trade-off against time taken and the cost of hardware needed for faster charging.

Suggested steps:
1.	Perform literature research prior to starting the work to understand the basics of EV battery packs, and charging/discharging circuits. Consider using the resources [here](https://mathworks.com/solutions/power-electronics-control/battery-models.html).
2.	Create a model of the Battery Pack within an EV, ensuring the sizing and battery chemistry is appropriate for contemporary applications. Consider using a [generic battery model]( https://in.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sps/powersys/ref/battery.html) as a starting point.
3.	Create a model of a second, external battery pack, which will be used to recharge the EV. The size and configuration of this should be parametrized, so that the cost and charging rate can be optimized.
4.	 Model the intermediate power electronic charging circuit, ensuring the electrical and thermal characteristics of the conversion are within an acceptable range. Consider using the examples provided in the Simscape Electrical library [here]( https://in.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sps/power-electronics.html). 
5.	Verify the suitability of the charging control algorithms and power electronics design through simulations.

Advanced project work:
1.	Customize the design to match various popular EV manufacturers.
2.	Use the model to compare the speed and cost of different charging technologies, battery chemistries and cell configurations.
3.	Build and test the actual hardware
