## Motivation

Recently, more than 2,300 US businesses accept bitcoin, according to an estimate from late 2020. The cryptocurrency trading presents a host of opportunities and challenges. External factors, such as financial news and social media, have wide impacts on the crypto price movements. For this reason, it is important to research on the effectiveness of twitter posts, as a main social media platform, to the cryptocurrency trading strategies. Sentiment analysis is a sub-research area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) studies. Twitter sentiment analysis can provide insights that indicate positive or negative attitudes on the cryptocurrency. Moreover, due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency price, the analysis on social media sentiments and cryptocurrencies’ time series will improve the trading strategies a lot. Based on your research, build the optimal portfolio of cash and cryptocurrencies to maximize the revenues given a certain level of risk. 

## Project Description

Analyze data from Twitter posts about cryptocurrency to discover the current overall feelings of people towards cryptocurrency and use your findings to build the optimal trading strategy.
Work with the [Datafeed Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/datafeed.html), [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) and [Deep Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html ) products to retrieve the social media data, build the time series models with the sentiment scores, and trading strategies. 

Suggested steps:
1.	Become familiar with the MATLAB based deep learning, text analytics examples listed in Background Material section below.
2.	Retrieve the tweets from Twitter on cryptocurrencies using the [Twitter connection object]( https://www.mathworks.com/help/datafeed/twitter.html) from the Datafeed Toolbox
3.	Apply a [classification algorithm]( https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/classification.html) from the Statistics and Machine learning Toolbox to determine the sentiment scores and compare the results against the existing [VADER](https://www.mathworks.com/help/textanalytics/ref/vadersentimentscores.html) and [ratio rule](https://www.mathworks.com/help/textanalytics/ref/ratiosentimentscores.html)  methods from the [Text Analytics toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/classification.html)
4.	Use a Large Language Model via [MATLAB API](https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/llms-with-matlab) to retrieve features to build the time series model 
5.	Build the time series model of cryptocurrency, considering the sentiment scores as a factor in the model using the [Econometrics Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/econometrics.html).
6.	Design algorithm trading strategies on cryptocurrency using [Financial Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/finance.html). Back test the portfolio performance.

Project variations:
1.	Apply [python integration in MATLAB]( https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html) to overcome the current limited data range retrieval functionality. 
2.	Model selection: Select one or more of these models to test the performance of the trading strategy: cryptocurrency time series model,  factor model, deep learning or reinforcement learning model.

Advanced project work:
1.	Build an interactive app on trading strategies on cryptocurrency data.
2.	Utilize  more advanced techniques to improve the performance of the crypto currency trading strategies. For example see some methods introduced in the papers in the background material section.
3.	Immigrate the same methodology onto the equity market or fixed-income market
