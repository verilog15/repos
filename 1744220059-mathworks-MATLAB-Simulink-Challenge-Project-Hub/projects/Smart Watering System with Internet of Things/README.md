## Motivation

Drought and hunger affect hundreds of millions of people around the world. Pressures from increasing population, inequity, climate change, and water shortages contribute to this challenge. Agriculture accounts for approximately 80 percent of the consumptive water use in the United States. Cutting-edge technologies like AI and IoT will be instrumental in fostering sustainable agricultural practices.
Efficient irrigation systems can help conserve resources and maintain farm profitability in an era of increasing food demand and rising costs. IoT-driven systems can automatically monitor, analyze, and precisely regulate water demand and supply, to minimize water overuse and eliminate the need for human intervention.
You can be a pioneer in the field of smart agriculture. Use cutting-edge technology to save water and optimize agricultural practices.


## Project Description

The Internet of Things gives increased access to and control of smart devices. Sensors on these smart devices measure certain types of data, and the power of IoT can transfer that data to the cloud, where it can be used to make real-time decisions.

Design an IoT-enabled system that will manage plant irrigation to optimize water use. Use low-cost hardware to interface with sensors, collect the data on the cloud and determine when and how the plants are watered.

Suggested steps:
1.	Collect agriculture data from sensors (Temp., Humidity, Soil Moisture, etc) 
2.	Upload this data to [ThingSpeak™](https://thingspeak.com/) (IoT analytics platform)
3.	Access and Analyze this data using ThingSpeak, see some [Examples](https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/examples.html). E.g., Estimate [Evapotranspiration](http://www.fao.org/3/X0490E/x0490e0a.htm) of the field based on the input data
4.	Gather other relevant information like weather forecast data or crop parameters
5.	Determine a watering strategy based on the crop type and the data you have gathered. For example, identify how your measurements and data could help develop a predictive model in MATLAB® to determine when the crop needs to be watered
6.	Send an action based on the analysis. This action could be as simple as an [e-mail notification](https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/act-on-your-data.html) to water the plants or actuate a watering system at the plant.

Here are the various phases of the project:
-	Develop the requirements
-	Design the architecture and specifications of the system
-	Select the hardware (sensors, embedded systems)
-	Build the system
-	Test it on a simplified use case
-	Develop analytics for the system (E.g., Forecast the amount of water used over the season for a location)

Advanced project work:
-	Add more sensors to gather different types of data such as light, airflow, and pH
-	Develop models for soil management (e.g., fertilization)
-	Imaging to monitor crop health (e.g., webcam, hyperspectral, or drone)
-	Develop AI models for Weather Prediction/Soil Characterization
