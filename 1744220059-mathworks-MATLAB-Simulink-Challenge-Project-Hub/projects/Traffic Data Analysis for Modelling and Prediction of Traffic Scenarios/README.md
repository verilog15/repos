## Motivation

The past few years, the world has been overwhelmed with large quantities of data from ubiquitous sources with the hope that AI can one day leverage them to evolve. With the autonomous driving industry booming, an increasing number of vehicle trajectories datasets are being recorded to help engineers and researchers improve autonomy algorithms and bring traffic simulation tools to the next level of realism. Therefore, the need arises to establish data processing and analysis methodologies using machine learning techniques that would efficiently leverage the growing traffic data. 

## Project Description

Work with [Deep Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html) and  [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) to process and analyze real-world vehicle trajectories data, such as the [Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) Vehicle Trajectories](https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Vehicle-Trajector/8ect-6jqj) data provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation. 

Objective:

Enable decision making in autonomous driving by predicting future vehicle trajectories using deep learning and machine learning algorithms, for example, LSTM neural networks in [2] and [3], and Bayes and decision-tree classifiers in [4].  

Advanced objective: 

Classify the trajectories based on intrinsic attributes (e.g., human driving styles – tired, in a hurry, distracted, aggressive, etc., driving modes – entering the driveway, exiting the driveway, passing a car, trailing a car, changing lanes, etc.), using unsupervised learning.

Suggested steps:
1.	Perform literature research prior to starting the work. Suggested readings are provided in the Background Material below. 
2.	Select the dataset(s) you will be using for your analysis. Depending on your analysis objective, consider parameters such as road topology, number of provided vehicle trajectories, measured quantities (position, velocity, acceleration, etc.), any available labels (e.g., type of vehicles, type of maneuver, driving profile, etc.) and more.
3.	Download the vehicle trajectories datasets. Some options are:
	- [Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) Vehicle Trajectories](https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Vehicle-Trajector/8ect-6jqj) provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation
	- [Dataset of Annotated Car Trajectories (DACT)](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/DACT_Dataset_of_Annotated_Car_Trajectories/5005289)
4.	Preprocess and visualize the data using MATLAB. The live script [preprocess_visualize_NGSIM_US101data.mlx](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/blob/main/projects/Traffic%20Data%20Analysis%20for%20Modelling%20and%20Prediction%20of%20Traffic%20Scenarios/preprocess_visualize_NGSIM_US101data.mlx) provided in the supporting material preprocesses the NGSIM data captured on US101 highway and visualizes them using Mapping Toolbox. You are encouraged to use this script as a starting point for other datasets. 
5.	[Optional] Visualize and replay the recorded trajectories in the Unreal Engine using [RoadRunner](https://www.mathworks.com/products/roadrunner.html) and Simulink. 
6.	Select the algorithmic solution that best suits your analysis objective, e.g., Bayesian Networks, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks, Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical, etc.), Gaussian mixture models, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc. 
7.	Separate the data in testing and training datasets.  
8.	Setup the problem formulation: determine the inputs, outputs, required intermediate data that are not directly available in the original datasets, such as information about the preceding cars, etc. 
9.	Use MATLAB and Simulink to design and/or implement an algorithmic solution that uses the data to achieve your analysis objective. You are encouraged to get inspiration from the provided readings. 
10.	Test the approach on the testing datasets and report efficiency.
11.	Document the results, challenges, and potential future work.
