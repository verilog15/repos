## Motivation

Online shopping and fast delivery have been the focus of ecommerce giants. Large warehouses storage and retrieval of multiple items have been the key for fast delivery of items to the customers. Robots (ground robots, aerial robots, manipulators robots) play a major role in automating this process for many warehouse applications. Simulation is the key to understanding the different scenarios, determining the suitability of the algorithms, and optimizing the warehouse design and robot requirements.

## Project Description

This project focuses on the design and simulation of warehouse robotic operations. Using the functionality available in perception, navigation, fusion, and applications products listed here, [Computer Vision Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html), [Navigation Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/navigation.html), [Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/sensor-fusion-and-tracking.html ), [UAV Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/uav.html), and [Robotics System Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html), simulates the warehouse operations and ascertains their efficiency and suitability for the task at hand. The [Gazebo-Cosim](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/perform-co-simulation-between-simulink-and-gazebo.html) Co-simulation capability can be leveraged to ease the integration of Gazebo simulation into the rest of the processing workflow. Here are some suggested steps to get you started on the project.

Suggested Steps:
1.	Start with the existing MATLAB example [A* Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance in a Warehouse](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/a-star-path-planning-and-obstacle-avoidance.html) where a single robot is used to move around the warehouse avoiding obstacles. 
2.	Extend that example by placing multiple robots in the warehouse
3.	Develop a multirobot mobility and a task scheduling algorithm to simulate coordinated tasks, see reference [1] for further details on a sample algorithm to get you started.

Recommended Project Variations:

-	Vary the type of robot model used in the simulation using the robot library available in [Robotics System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ref/loadrobot.html)
-	Simulate multirobot pick and place tasks. [Pick and Place Example](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/pick-and-place-workflow-using-stateflow.html )
-	Warehouse operation involving moving material using coordinated robots
