## Motivation

Wind turbines are a fast-growing source of renewable energy worldwide. When turbines break down unexpectedly, repairs can be costly and energy production can be disrupted. While regular maintenance can prevent some of these issues, unnecessary down time can be expensive and disruptive. By using properly trained models, predictive maintenance can ensure that the right interventions are done at the right time, keeping the flow of electricity high and costs low.
Properly constructed models can help predict behavior in physical systems, especially if trained using machine learning. Running simulations through varying situations can provide data to teach expected behavior.

## Project Description

Work with [Simscape™ Driveline™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape-driveline.html) to create a plant and fault model for wind turbines using MATLAB® and Simulink®. 
The model should be detailed enough to capture important dynamics.
Demonstrate that out of spec performance and component failure can be predicted by identifying data that varies but is still within spec.
Determine the most useful set of sensors to ensure that predictive maintenance is possible without adding too much cost and complexity.

Suggested steps:
1.	Perform a literature search to understand wind turbines and predictive maintenance.
2.	Create a dynamic wind turbine model.
3.	Determine fault conditions that could cause a turbine to be damaged or taken out of service.
4.	Model different scenarios including manufacturing differences, wind loads, and wind direction.
5.	Determine if you can predict faults before they occur by observing key simulation data.
6.	Train a predictive maintenance model using many runs of the simulation.

Advanced project work:

Find real data on failed turbines and determine if the model could have predicted it.
